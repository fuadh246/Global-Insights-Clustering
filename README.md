# Global-Insights-Clustering
Global Insights: Country Clustering Analysis Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to provide insights into global data through clustering analysis. By leveraging clustering algorithms, the project seeks to group similar data points together, thereby revealing patterns and structures within the dataset. This can facilitate understanding and decision-making in various domains such as business, economics, and social sciences.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: The notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, including summary statistics, visualization of distributions, and identification of potential outliers.
- **Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps are included to clean and prepare the dataset for clustering analysis. This may involve handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Several clustering algorithms are implemented and evaluated in the notebook. Common algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering may be utilized to cluster the data points.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance metrics for evaluating clustering results are discussed and computed. These metrics help assess the quality of clustering and aid in selecting the most appropriate algorithm and parameter settings.
- **Visualization**: The notebook includes visualizations of clustering results to aid in interpretation and understanding. This may involve plotting clusters in feature space or visualizing cluster centroids.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
